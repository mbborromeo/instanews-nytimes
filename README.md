# Development steps/process
0. Read & understand the Project Requirements (https://red-wdp.herokuapp.com/project/project-03/)
1. Set up project in NPM and ensure a package.json file is created
2. Set up Git source management including .gitignore and README.md files
3. Install Gulp so SASS can compile
4. Develop draft CSS layout using static images/content as a placeholder
5. Convert CSS to SASS syntax for better style management
6. Implement mobile-first Responsive Web Design techniques using CSS/SASS Media Queries, and pay attention to breakpoints decided in Mockup Design provided in project brief/requirements
7. Implement jQuery AJAX call to NY Times API to pull actual content
8. Use Javascript/jQuery to dynamically create HTML elements by using control flow (conditionals and for-loops)
9. Cater for edge-cases, and test these in the browser console (if an article doesn't have an image, don't display this article)
10. Edit your SASS styles to suit dynamically created elements if necessary
11. Test your website on multiple browsers and devices, and fix if need be
12. Continually save and commit your work in Git (all work on a single commit should be related to one feature/improvement/fix)
13. Once you've achieved the mandatory functional requirements, clean up your unecessary code, unclear comments, or un-needed console.logs
14. W3C Validate your HTML and CSS syntax, and fix errors if necessary
15. Use HTML5 semantic tags to imply meaning and add more importance for SEO and Accessibility
16. Check the Project Requirements again to see if you have covered all the mandatory tasks
17. Save/commit your work again, and put it aside as a version you can submit
18. If you have time, attempt some Stretch Goals from the Project Requirements
19. Ensure your README.md file includes project description/features, technologies used, installation instructions, things still to do/improve on
20. Submit your work before the deadline

Note: Remember you can always go back and revisit things in your own time, and you will also have a chance to re-submit before the end of the program.  Professional Web/Software companies always release a newer version or an update, so it is a normal part of the process to not get it 100% perfect the first go, and to break things up into stages/releases focusing on mandatory functionality as a priority.
