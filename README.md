# Development steps/process
0. Understand the project requirements and design mockups
1. Set up project in NPM and ensure a package.json file is created
2. Set up Git source management including .gitignore and README.md files
3. Install Gulp so SASS can compile
4. Develop draft CSS layout using static images/content as a placeholder
5. Convert CSS to SASS syntax for better style management
6. Implement mobile-first Responsive Web Design techniques using CSS/SASS Media Queries, and pay attention to breakpoints decided in Mockup Design provided in project brief/requirements
7. Implement jQuery AJAX call to NY Times API to pull actual content
8. Use Javascript/jQuery to dynamically create HTML elements by using control flow (conditionals and for-loops)
9. Cater for edge-cases, and test these in the browser console (if an article doesn't have an image, don't display this article)
10. Edit your SASS styles to suit dynamically created elements if necessary
11. Test your website on multiple browsers and devices, and fix if need be
12. Continually save and commit your work in Git (all work on a single commit should be related to one feature/improvement/fix)
13. Clean up your unecessary code, unclear comments, or un-needed console.logs
14. W3C Validate your HTML and CSS syntax, and fix errors if necessary
15. Use HTML5 semantic tags to imply meaning and add more importance for SEO and Accessibility
16. Add improvements, fix any bugs, add extra functionality
17. Ensure your README.md file includes project description/features, technologies used, installation instructions, things still to do/improve on

# To Do
