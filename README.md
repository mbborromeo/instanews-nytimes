# Development steps/process
0. Read & understand the Project 3 Requirements (https://red-wdp.herokuapp.com/project/project-03/).
1. Set up project in NPM and create package.json file.
2. Set up Git source management including .gitignore and README.md files.
3. Install Gulp so SASS can compile.
4. Develop draft CSS layout using static images/content.
5. Convert CSS to SASS syntax for better style management.
6. Implement mobile-first Responsive Web Design techniques using CSS/SASS Media Queries, and pay attention to breakpoints decided in Mockup Design provided in project brief/requirements.
7. Implement jQuery AJAX call to NY Times API to pull actual content.
8. Use Javascript/jQuery to dynamically create HTML elements (and remove your draft static content).
9. Edit your SASS styles to suit dynamically created elements if necessary.
10. Continually save and commit your work in Git (all work on a single commit should be related to one feature/improvement/fix).
11. Once you've achieved the mandatory functional requirements, clean up your unecessary code, unclear comments, or un-needed console.logs.
12. Check the Project 3 Requirements again to see if you have covered all the mandatory tasks. 
13. W3C Validate your HTML and CSS syntax, and fix errors if necessary.
14. Use HTML5 semantic tags to imply meaning and add more importance for SEO and Accessibility.
15. Save/commit your work again, and put it aside as a version you can submit.
16. If you have time, attempt some Stretch Goals from the Project Requirements.
17. Submit your work before the deadline, and give yourself a pat on the back.

Note: Remember you can always go back and revisit things in your own time, and you will also have a chance to re-submit before the end of the program.  Professional Web/Software companies always release a newer version or an update, so it is a normal part of the process to not get it 100% perfect the first go, and to break things up into stages/releases focusing on mandatory functionality as a priority.
